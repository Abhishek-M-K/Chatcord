## Chatcord - Next.js 13 Discord Clone

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
